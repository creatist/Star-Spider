# Star-Spider
use selenium and PhantomJS to extract Stars pictures , movies and their friends information

The project is undev development.
Next ,I maybe add these code into a Scrapy project.  
Please forgive me for my poor English.
I'd better you put a patch on selenium module if you want to run my code. 
See my other repository for details.  https://github.com/creatist/selenium-patch-for-setting-http-request-headers
